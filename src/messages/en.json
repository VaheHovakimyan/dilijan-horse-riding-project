      "description": "Dilijan Horse Riding, a center for horse riding and extreme sports in the mountains, was established on May 8, 2022, in the village of Haghartsin in the Tavush region. It was founded by Artsrun Voskanyan, a highly respected resident of the village and one of Armenia‚Äôs leading horse breeders, along with his son Sarkis and their friend Marut. Initially, the idea was to offer mountain trips in Armenia as an additional attraction for tourists, fostering a love for nature, animals, and Armenia‚Äôs natural beauty. Over time, the project expanded to include new directions in tourism, such as off-road trips, excursions to Mount Dimats and other sights in Tavush, corporate group trips, weekly tours, photo sessions, and a range of additional services."
